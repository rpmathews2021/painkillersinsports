<h2 class="header2">Positives of Painkillers:</h2>
<p class=p>&nbsp;Although there are not many positives there are a few.&nbsp; Painkillers are very effective.&nbsp; Painkillers almost seem neccisary in a sport like american football when you step on the field there is a 4.1% chance of getting injuried.(ProFootballLogic)&nbsp; Most painkillers cut off the brains access to the feeling of pain several different ways creating this feeling of no pain.(Webmd)&nbsp; These medicines are very effective, which might seem pretty good in you have just torn your acl.&nbsp; But other than that there are no other real positves about painkillers.&nbsp;</p>

</center>
<p class=p>Painkillers are extremely addictive, several stories about players taking these drugs and having their lifes ruined have surfaced.&nbsp; Take Kyle Turley for example who recently came out about his problem with the medications in an interview with vice sports.&nbsp; He talks about how they effected his attitude and how they negatively impacted his life.&nbsp; He talks about one time having stockpiles of painkillers because of their availability to him.&nbsp; These drugs shouldnt be as available as they are. Recently the NFL cam out with a statement that in the calendar year 2012 "the average team prescribed nearly 5,777 doses of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and 2,213 doses of controlled medications to its players, according to a March 2013 internal document from Lawrence Brown, the NFL-employed medical adviser who oversees its drug issues."(Washington Post)Painkillers are also very dangerous, a very painkiller Vioxx was pulled of shelves on September 30, 2004 because of their connection to increased heart failure in patients.(Robinskaplin)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class=p>&nbsp;Many would believe that with the difference in risk that it is absurd that marijuana hasnt already been tried in professional sports especially the NFL where they have an epidemic with these .&nbsp; But the NFL has marijuana as a banned substance and a failed test could lead to a four game suspension.(Washington Post)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
