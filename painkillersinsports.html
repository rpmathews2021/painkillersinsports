<p class=p>&nbsp;In professional sports injuries are very common, whether it is in practice or in games.&nbsp; But some professional leagues like the NFL have a problem with painkillers.&nbsp; These drugs are prescribed to help with the pain from injuries.&nbsp; Not only can these drugs be potentially deadly they also can lead to life long addictions that could ruin lives.&nbsp; In this analysis i will be talking most about the NFL because of the availability of the information and the stories from the athletes themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Positives of Painkillers:</h2>
<p class=p>&nbsp;Although there are not many positives there are a few.&nbsp; Painkillers are very effective.&nbsp; Painkillers almost seem neccisary in a sport like american football when you step on the field there is a 4.1% chance of getting injuried.(ProFootballLogic)&nbsp; Most painkillers cut off the brains access to the feeling of pain several different ways creating this feeling of no pain.(Webmd)&nbsp; These medicines are very effective, which might seem pretty good in you have just torn your acl.&nbsp; But other than that there are no other real positves about painkillers.&nbsp;</p>

<img src="painkiller2.jpg" alt= "multiple bottles of painkillers.">
<p class=p>Painkillers are extremely addictive, several stories about players taking these drugs have surfaced.&nbsp; Take Kyle Turley for example who recently came out about his problem with the medications in an interview with vice sports.&nbsp; He talks about how they effected his attitude and how they negatively impacted his life.&nbsp; He talks about one time having stockpiles of painkillers because of their availability to him.&nbsp; These drugs shouldnt be as available as they are. Recently the NFL cam out with a statement that in the calendar year 2012 "the average team prescribed nearly 5,777 doses of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and 2,213 doses of controlled medications to its players, according to a March 2013 internal document from Lawrence Brown, the NFL-employed medical adviser who oversees its drug issues."(Washington Post)Painkillers are also very dangerous, a very painkiller Vioxx was pulled of shelves on September 30, 2004 because of their connection to increased heart failure in patients.(Robinskaplin)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
